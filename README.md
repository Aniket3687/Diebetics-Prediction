Diabetics prediction using Machine Learning

Name: Aniket Purushottam Gawande

The dataset used has 7 columns (Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age). Using machine learning algorithm (K-Nearest Neighbours) we are predicting the status of the patient i.e. normal or dibetic. First we load the data so that we can use it for prediction. After that the data is normalize so that it is in the range of 0 and 1. After that data is split in train and test (train data is 67% and test data is 33%). Train data is used to train the model and test data is used to test the model. After the model is trained we got accuracy of 65.74% accuracy.
